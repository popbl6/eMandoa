\noindent The report goes through the building of a P2P application using CORBA. Following the unified process, diagrams with increasing maturity level are sketched chronologically, starting with the idea of what the program should do (writing the user case diagram and the IDL file) and finishing with actually how the program does it (case diagrams). The start of work is in the Methodology section, in which the start (first diagrams) and the way of working are explained. After that, the broader presentation section comes, with screenshots of the intended program and different sequence diagrams, with the aim of showing the interaction of the different parts of the distributed applications as clear as possible, instead of focusing in the software engineering side of the problem. Furthermore, each diagram has a small explanation to expand the understanding of processes.Finally, in the appendices, a mention of design patterns and their application in the project is made, along with the bibliography.
